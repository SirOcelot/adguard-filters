# AdGuard Filters

This repository holds a lightweight allowlist for AdGuard Home, focused on avoiding false positives for banking, streaming, retail, productivity, and common CDN domains.

## Files

## How to use with AdGuard Home
1. Upload `allowlist.txt` to this repository's `main` branch.
2. Get the raw URL, which will look like:
